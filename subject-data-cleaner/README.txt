INSTRUCTIONS:

1. put scheduler-subject-data-cleaner-4.3.0-SNAPSHOT-dist.zip file in a new folder


2. Run the following:

unzip scheduler-subject-data-cleaner-4.3.0-SNAPSHOT-dist.zip
cd scheduler-subject-data-cleaner-4.3.0-SNAPSHOT
cd conf


3. edit subject-data-cleaner.properties as needed:
    set db credentials
    set encryption key parameters
    set subjectMode=default


4. edit log4j.properties if desired (it is already set up to log information in detail)


5. go back to the run directory

cd ..


6. display the program help screen

./subjectDataCleaner.sh -help


7. Run the program: the default program settings should work and provide output files in data-cleaner-output folder. i.e. just run:

./subjectDataCleaner.sh


8. By default the output files will be:

    data-cleaner-output/duplicateSubjectsToCurate.csv
    data-cleaner-output/nonDuplicateSubjectsToCurate.csv
    subject-data-cleaner.log


9. Note that the subject-data-cleaner.log does not get overwritten when the program runs; new log messages are concatenated to the end of the log file.
This is useful for debugging. Please archive the log file when it gets too large.


10. Sometimes with test data that does not mock real data well enough, the program may run very slowly,
or it may not produce many matches. There are two test-mode switches to help with that:

    -noMatchOnFullNamesOnly
    -matchOnLastnameAndBirthdate
