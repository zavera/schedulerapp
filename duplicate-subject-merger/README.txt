INSTRUCTIONS:

1. put scheduler-duplicate-subject-merger-4.3.0-SNAPSHOT-dist.zip file in a new folder


2. Run the following:

unzip scheduler-duplicate-subject-merger-4.3.0-SNAPSHOT-dist.zip
cd scheduler-duplicate-subject-merger-4.3.0-SNAPSHOT
cd conf


3. edit subject-data-merger.properties as needed:
    set db credentials
    set encryption key parameters
    set subjectMode=default


4. edit log4j.properties if desired (it is already set up to log information in detail)


5. go back to the run directory

cd ..


6. Run the program: The input is a list of comma separated pairs of subject ids with no space between the commas. The first subject id is the one to merge and the second id is the destination id.
(i.e. 234,120 -> would mark the subject with id 234 as merged)

./subjectDataMerger.sh [-removeDupStudySubjects] <input csv file>


7. By default the output files will be:

    subject-data-merger.log

8. The switch following switch will delete any duplicate study subjects that occurs when a subject is merged (this only applies in cases where a subject is in a study with two completely different MRNs i.e 1234 BWH and 5647 MGH):
	-removeDupStudySubjects

9. Note that the subject-data-merger.log does not get overwritten when the program runs; new log messages are concatenated to the end of the log file.
This is useful for debugging. Please archive the log file when it gets too large.
